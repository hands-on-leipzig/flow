# Table Review #27: migrations

## Status: ✅ System Table (Skip)

## Note

This is a **Laravel system table** for tracking which migrations have been executed, not part of our application schema. It's created and managed by Laravel's migration system and doesn't need to be in the master migration.

**Action**: Skip review - this is a Laravel framework table.
